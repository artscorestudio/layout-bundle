# Artscore Studio Layout Bundle

Layout Bundle is a Symfony 2/3 component providing frontend and backend layouts in your Symfony 2/3 application based on jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap. This package is a part of Artscore Studio Framework.

Why ? For my personnal developments, I use jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap. When I started new Symfony project, I wanted to get jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap in basic Twig template just by installing a bundle and boom ! I have a User Interface in place !

But this bundle allows you to enable or disable external libraries or add more libraries supports. We will see this later.

> IMPORTANT NOTICE: This bundle is still under development. Any changes will be done without prior notice to consumers of this package. Of course this code will become stable at a certain point, but for now, use at your own risk.

> BE CARREFUL : This bundle does not include external libraries, you must install the libraries via Compoer, in accordance with best practices of Symfony documentation or with tools designed for managing assets like Bower.

## Installation

### Step 1 : Download ASFLayoutBundle using composer

Require the bundle with composer :

```bash
$ composer require artscorestudio/layout-bundle "^1.2"
```

Composer will install the bundle to your project's *vendor/artscorestudio/layout-bundle* directory. It also install dependencies. 

### Step 2 : Enable the bundle

Enable the bundle in the kernel :

```php
// app/AppKernel.php

public function registerBundles()
{
   $bundles = array(
      // ...
      new ASF\LayoutBundle\ASFLayoutBundle()
      // ...
   );
}
```

### Step 3 : Configure the bundle for a quickly use of it with jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap

For a quickly access to a basic template based on jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap, just add jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap in your project's composer.json file or with tools like Bower.

By default, LayoutBundle have this paths for jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap :

```yaml
asf_layout:
    assets:
        jquery:
            path: "%kernel.root_dir%/../vendor/components/jquery/jquery.min.js"
        twbs:
            twbs_dir: "%kernel.root_dir%/../vendor/components/bootstrap/"
```

For further informations about installation of external libraries via Composer see [Enable/Disable supported assets][12].

> Don't forget to set Assetic Configuration ([see Assetic Installation instructions][23]).

### Step 4 : Extend model layouts

Open your base template and extend model templates from Layout bundle :

```twig
// app/Resources/views/base.html.twig
{% extends ASFLayoutBundle::frontend_model.html.twig %}
```

And it's done ! If you go in your favorite browser, you have basic template for your project based on jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap.
You can use it as this or overriding it !

LayoutBundle provides another base layout call *backend_layout.html.twig*. For more informations about provided layouts, please see [Layout models provided by ASFLayoutBundle][13].
