# Artscore Studio Layout Bundle

Layout Bundle is a Symfony 2/3 component providing frontend and backend layout models in your Symfony 2/3 application based on jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap. This package is a part of Artscore Studio Framework.

Why ? For my personnal developments, I use jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap. When I started new Symfony project, I wanted to get jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap in basic Twig template just by installing a bundle and boom ! I have a User Interface in place !

But this bundle allows you to enable or disable external libraries or add more libraries supports. We will see this later.

> IMPORTANT NOTICE: This bundle is still under development. Any changes will be done without prior notice to consumers of this package. Of course this code will become stable at a certain point, but for now, use at your own risk.

> BE CARREFUL : This bundle does not include external libraries, you must install the libraries via Compoer, in accordance with best practices of Symfony documentation.

Composer will install the bundle to your project's *vendor/artscorestudio/layout-bundle* directory. It also install dependencies. 

### Step 2 : Enable the bundle

```

### Step 3 : Configure the bundle for a quickly use of it with jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap

For a quickly access to a basic template based on jQuery and Twitter Bottstrap, just add jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap in your project's composer.json file.

For install jQuery, add it to your project's composer.json file :

```bash
$ composer require components/jquery "2.2.*"
````````````````````````````````````````````

And for install Twitter Bootstrap, add it to your project's composer.json file :

```bash
$ composer require components/bootstrap "3.3.*"
```````````````````````````````````````````````

By default, Layout bundle use Less files directly. Enable Less by isntall it on your system and add it in your project's config.yml file.

Less configuration on *nix operating systems :

```yaml
# /app/config/config.yml
assetic:
    filters:
        cssrewrite: ~
        less:
            node: "/usr/local/bin/node"
node_paths: ["/usr/local/lib/node_modules/"]
````````````````````````````````````````````

Less configuration on Microsoft Windows operating systems (Windows 7+) :

```yaml
# /app/config/config.yml
assetic:
    filters:
        cssrewrite: ~
        less:
            node: "C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\node.exe"
node_paths: ["C:\\Users\\__USERNAME__\\AppData\\Roaming\\npm\\node_modules"]
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

For enable all supported assets, please check [Enable/Disable supported assets](enable-external-library.md) in this documentation.

### Step 4 : Extend model layouts

Open your base template and extend model templates from Layout bundle :

```twig
// app/Resources/views/base.html.twig
{% extends ASFLayoutBundle::frontend_layout.html.twig %}
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

And it's done ! If you go in your favorite browser, you have basic template for your project based on jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap.
You can use it as this or overriding it !
